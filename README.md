# Flashcard-Generator

## Make flash cards.

## Choose between basic or cloze-deleted statements.

## Display "front" (question), "back" (answer), or both. Example:

```js
	var newCard = new BasicFlashcard (front, back);
	BasicFlashcard.displayFront();
	BasicFlashcard.displayBack();
	BasicFlashcard.displayAll();
```

## Cards are stored in separate text files for basic or cloze-deleted statements.
